Additionally, there are alignment issues with the subheadings and body text which creates a disorganized look.\n\n- Section D: The layout is more conventional like Section C; however, Section D contains a subtle design flaw where the subheadings and the related text blocks have varying alignments, making the overall appearance less structured and professional compared to Section C.\n\nTherefore, Section C is the correctly and cleanly designed section.",
